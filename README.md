 System Health Check Script (healthcheck.sh)

This project automates Linux system monitoring by collecting real-time health data such as uptime, CPU load, memory, disk usage, and running service status.  
It generates a timestamped log file for easy auditing.


Features

Displays system date and time  
Shows system uptime  
Reports CPU load averages  
Displays memory and disk usage  
Lists top 5 memory-consuming processes  
Checks status of essential services (nginx, ssh, docker)  
Logs everything into a timestamped file (e.g., `healthlog_2025-10-28_12-45-30.txt`)

How to Use

1️ Give execute permission:

chmod +x healthcheck.sh


2️ Run the script:

./healthcheck.sh


3️ View the log file:
After running, the script automatically generates a log file in the same folder.
Example:

healthlog_2025-10-28_12-45-30.txt

==================== END OF REPORT ===========================

 How It Works

The script uses standard Linux commands to gather system metrics:

date → shows current date and time

uptime → shows how long the system has been running

free -m → checks memory usage in MB

df -h → shows disk space usage

ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 6 → lists top memory-consuming processes

systemctl is-active → checks if services like nginx, ssh, and docker are running

All this data is formatted and saved into a log file with the current date and time.

 Example Use Case

You can use this script to:

Monitor server health automatically

Schedule daily checks using cron jobs

Keep historical logs for troubleshooting and audits

Example cron job (runs every day at 9 AM):

0 9 * * * /path/to/healthcheck.sh
